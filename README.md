Capstone - December 2022

## Team Members
- Dylan Olsen
- Maurine Arandi
- Sam Johnson

## Motivation

- The motivation was to create a decentralized application that will allow users to originate and store artwork as the NFTs. Along the way, we also created a gallery to display and sell the NFTs. We used Solidity via Remix to create the contracts and Streamlit for the dApp. All artwork is registered to Pinata



## Executive Summary

In our attempt to stay true to our mission, we have created a new tool that allows our investors to invest in digital artwork with simplicity, cost reduction and decentralization using solidity contracts under ERC721 standards. 

Users are able to create their own digital, tokenize it and own it as an NFT. There is also an option to buy/sell already existing art through our gallery.
