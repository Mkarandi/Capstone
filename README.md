## Overview and summary

We were motivated to create an Ethereum based decentralized application that will allow users to originate and store artwork as the NFTs. Along the way, we also created a gallery to display and sell the NFTs. We used Solidity via Remix to create the contracts and Streamlit for the dApp. All artwork is registered to IPFS via Pinata.

In our attempt to stay true to our mission, we have created a new tool that  our investors will utilize to invest in digital artwork with simplicity, cost reduction and decentralization using solidity contracts under ERC721 standards. 

Users are able to create their own digital, tokenize it and own it as an NFT. There is also an option to buy/sell already existing art through our gallery. 

## Technology requirements
### pip install
- Streamlit (pip install)
- streamlit_player (pip install)
- openai (pip install)
- web3 (pip install)
- mnemonic(pip install)
- Metamask extenstion
- Ganache

## Techniques
There were 3 main components to successfully creating the dApp:
1. Create the contract in Remix IDE using solidity
2. Create and deploy the contract using python and streamlit
3. Register the artwork to IPFS using pinata
