Capstone - December 2022

## Team Members

## Motivation

- The motivation was to create a decentralized application that will allow users to originate and store artwork as the NFTs. Along the way, we also created a gallery to display and sell the artwork as NFTs. Solidity and Streamlit were the 2 main. The core idea was to efficiently make profitable trades in the stock market.
